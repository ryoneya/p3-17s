# ch5-Flickr


In this project, I first made a page that pulls images from flikr by modifying the javascript file and the html file. Then I made another page that pulls images from 500px by creating new javascript an html. Then I uploaded them to our 281 UO webpage.

### Deployment
As part of this project, we deployed our web app to UOregon.edu.
